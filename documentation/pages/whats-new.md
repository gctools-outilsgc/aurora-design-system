# What's New

Latest updates to the \#GCDigital Design System.

### June 2018

Now in Phase II, the design team has split into smaller working teams, including developers, writers, designers, and UX researchers. We are conducting usability testing on some of our elements, developing style sheets and HTML components, and creating wire-frames to build the first iteration of the design system website. 

The first iteration of the design system is in review. We are making small changes to components, ensuring consistency in our [UI kit](https://github.com/gctools-outilsgc/design-system/tree/master/user%20interface%20kit), and editing documentation. Take a look at our Github for some of our [research reports](https://github.com/gctools-outilsgc/design-system/tree/master/ux%20testing) and [example prototypes](https://github.com/gctools-outilsgc/design-system/tree/master/page%20prototypes)! 

Sierra also wrote a [blog post](https://medium.com/@s.duffey121/7-things-i-learned-from-leading-a-design-project-7b003d25b5e2) outlining some of the key lessons learned from the project. 

### **April 2018**

The \#GCdigital design team is hard at work creating a first draft of the \#GCdigital design system. Browse through our Gitbook to see what's been done so far and what we're still working on!

The first phase of the design system will focus on key design elements, and a downloadable user interface \(UI\) kit. We are finishing the last few elements related to navigation, data visualizations and animations, as well as reviewing previous work.

Development work for the design elements will start mid-May. Interested in helping us code our components? [Contact us!](mailto:%20sierra.duffey@tbs-sct.gc.ca)
