## When to Use a Link

Buttons and links serve different purposes: buttons are used for actions, whereas links are used for navigation. Avoid using links to indicate actions, even if they are secondary. Links should be used when a user is directed to a new section, page or website.

As a general rule, if the user is making changes to the back or front-end of the site when clicking, you should use a button. If the user is being directed to a different page, you can use a link.

## External Links

If a link is bringing the user to an external web page, this should be indicated using an icon and the page should open in a new window.

## Link Styling

Links should not exceed one line in length and be applied to 2-4 keywords rather than a full sentence or line.

Links should always include a hover state and a visited state and should look different from the rest of the text. In this system, links are displayed as follows:

**Regular:** Nunitio Sans Regular at 16 points

**Hover:** Nunitio Sans Regular at 16 points

**Visited:** Nunitio Sans Regular at 16 points

There are other colour options for visited links. Best practice for visited links is to use a muted version of your hyperlink colour, a secondary colour or the standard purple: \#551A8B.
