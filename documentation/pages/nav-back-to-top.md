# Nav: Back to top

_Back to top_ is a navigation button that allows users to quickly revert back to the top of a particular web page. This element is shown in the bottom right corner of the page or mobile screen. The element only appears when the user scrolls \_**\(distance\)** \_a certain amount down the web page.

_Back to top_ buttons are necessary for web pages with continuous scrolling, or a page that includes a long amount of content. A good guideline is to include a _Back to top_ button for any web page that is longer than 4 screens.

This button should always be labelled _Back to top_ since this is the most descriptive and expected label for the function.

*Back to top component*
