# Data: Scatterplots

Scatterplots are used to show correlation between points of data with two variables.

## Best Practices

![Scatterplot](https://github.com/gctools-outilsgc/design-system/blob/master/documentation/examples/scatterplot.png)

Always start your y-axis at 0. 

Trend lines aren't necessary but may help to emphasize correlations in your data. Only use trend lines if they accurately represent a strong correlation. 

To show clusters of data, use varying opacity levels on overlapping or near-overlapping data points to show layers, and make each point visually distinct.
