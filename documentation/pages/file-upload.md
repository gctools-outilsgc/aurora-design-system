# File Upload

File upload inputs are a combination of button and input field. They are included in forms where the user has the option to include files.

The user does not input text into the input field; it automatically gets filled with file information once a file has been chosen.

_Choose file_ is the action button to be selected by the user. Once clicked, the button opens a new window where the user can choose a file. File types are determined by the system parameters.
