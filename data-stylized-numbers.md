# Data: Stylized Numbers

Stylized numbers are a great addition to a statistics dashboard, or other content that visually represents data. Stylized numbers are used to emphasize certain statistics and quickly show an increase or decrease. 

Stylized numbers are styled as follows:

Number shown at Rubik Regular at 125 points. Text underneath the number and offset to the left. Text uses Heading 4 style \(Rubik Regular at 21 points\). Underneath the text and number the percentage is shown using Heading 5. The chevron on the left of the percentage shows either an increase or decrease. 

A decrease uses a chevron coloured \#923534 and an increase uses \#2B542C
