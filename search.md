Question for Gen/rebuild: _Application-wide v. site-specific search. Use filters?_

Search bars help the user find relevant content within your site or application. Search bars are a universal feature that is expected on most sites, particularly ones with large amounts of content.

Search bars are located in the top-right of the webpage, and function similarly to a form field, where the user can input keywords to create an output from the system.

Search bars in this system use placeholder text using the term _Search_

There are two style options for search:

**Option 1**

Text field with a padding of **12px.** On the right of the field there is a search icon that serves as an action button. The icon is sized at **1.2 em** and coloured with **\(\#666666\)**

**Option 2**

The same as option 1 with a border radius of **17px**.
