# Help Articles

\(This style guide is currently for Freshdesk. It will be updated and changed to suit the design system\).

### Titles

All article names/titles should be written in the form of a question. For example:

•    How can I create an account?

•    How do I use Search?

If the article can answer more than one complete question, you should split it in to multiple articles.

 Headings and Text

•    Font is the default Helvetica Neue

•    Always use the pre-set Freshdesk format options. Don’t use font sizes \(i.e.  Not “12pt”\).

o    Main Headings \(Top Level\) are Heading 2. Major sections should have headings.

o    Subheadings are Heading 3 and bolded. Subsections should have subheadings.

o    All other text is Normal.

•    Quotation marks are used when explaining something to be typed \(ex. “@”\)

•    Bolded words in text refer to buttons the user will click \(e.g. Post\)

•    Text is in black with white background, unless other colours are necessary to improve comprehension.

o    Tables are in grey scale \(see section\).

o    Hyperlinks are blue \(see section\).

 Notes, Tips and Warnings

•    Notes are in italics. Notes should also appear in brackets \(e.g. \(Note: This format\)\).

o    Notes are information that supplement the main text. They should not describe actions the user will take, but rather give information which answers questions the user may have.

    Example: \(Note: A group operator must be a member of the group\).

o    Notes should appear in-line with the text they directly refer to.

o    Notes should appear after the text block they refer to if they answer a more general question about the instructions.

o    Notes should appear before images that they refer to.

•    Tips are to be placed in this info box/example:

You are able to preview how your blog post will look before publishing by selecting Preview.

o    Tips are suggestions for the user. They aren’t necessary steps, but describe actions which may help the reader.

o    The text in the tip box should vertically aligned in the center and left-aligned.

•    Warnings are to be placed in this info box/example:

 If you delete your account, any contributions that you have made to GCconnex will also be lost with your account. Consider deactivating your account as an alternative to fully deleting it.

o    Warnings are issues that may arise. They may be errors, lost data, actions which are permanent or other problems. The text should also explain how to avoid these issues.

o    Typically, warnings should be placed before the text they are associated with.

o    The text in the warning box should be bolded, and vertically aligned in the center and left-aligned.

Paragraph Format

•    All text should be left aligned.

•    There should be no line breaks between headings, subheadings and paragraph text.

•    Always use single space. Spacing is exaggerated when the article is ported to GCcollab and GCconnex.

•    Single space between paragraphs or sections.

•    No spacing between subtitles and their following paragraph text.

•    No indenting for headings, subheadings or paragraphs.

Lists

•    Non-ordered lists should be bulleted. They should appear with a single indent and a black dot.

o    For points that elaborate on a previous bullet, use the unfilled bullet and double indent.

o    Non-ordered lists should be preceded by an introductory sentence followed by a colon.

o    These lists should be parallel in sentence structure/tense whenever possible and end with punctuation.

•    Sequential lists/steps should be numbered in order. They should appear with a single indent.

o    Steps should only contain one action unless the actions are very closely related.

o    Whenever possible begin each step with the verb. End each step with punctuation.

o    Lists may be broken up by images.

Example:

Press the numbered list key.

Type the first step.

Press the space bar.

Type the second step.

Continue as needed.

Images

Images should be:

•    Sized for readability. Typically 700px in width \(as this size ports best to GCcollab and GCconnex\) unless stretching to this size makes the image hard to read.

•    Center aligned and break the text.

•    Below the text/step they are associated with.

•    Uncaptioned.

•    In the correct language \(i.e. French articles should have French images and vice versa\).

How to insert and format an image \(with examples of how to place it\):

Move your cursor to the end of the line of text you would like your image to reside below. \(Note: You cannot drag images\).

Click the insert image icon.

Locate and select the image you want to insert.

Click on the image in order to reveal an options menu.

Click the change size icon.

Resize to “700px” width if appropriate.

Click Display \(the star\) to make sure the image is formatted Break Text.

Click Align \(the lines\) and choose center.

Screenshots and Image Elements

•    Screenshots should be large enough that the user will understand the context and surroundings of the image.

•    Use a photo editing software \(ex. Microsoft Paint\) to make one of three symbols to point out different elements:

o    Circle: to show a button the user needs to click.

o    Rectangle: to bring attention to a large area, or multiple buttons or tabs.

o    Arrow:  Bring attention to a general area of a page, or to a circle or box that is not emphasised enough.

Tables

o    Use normal format

o    Make sure cell sizes do not create breaks within words.

o    Put a space before and after text so that text does not look crowded.

o    Center the text both vertically and horizontally in the cell.

o    Headers should be bolded.

o    Tables are in grey scale.

o    Header cells are cool grey.

o    Other cells are light grey.

o    Warm grey may be used in cells if further distinction is required.

Example of a table:

Button    Result

Main page    Brings you to the GCpedia home page

Communities

Browse categories

Random page    View a random GCpedia page

Hyperlinks

•    Hyperlinks are in blue.

•    When a user clicks a link to take them to a site or other article, we want it to be in a new tab. To do this:

To first add the link click the link icon \(or press Ctrl K\).

Fill in the appropriate information.

Go into code view.

Go to the source of the tag.

Add this element into the code: &lt;href&gt; tag: target=”\_blank”

For example:

&lt;href=”[https://gccollab.ca/newsfeed/”&gt;](https://gccollab.ca/newsfeed/”&gt); Click Here! &lt;/href&gt;

Becomes

&lt;href=”[https://gccollab.ca/newsfeed/”](https://gccollab.ca/newsfeed/”) target=”\_blank”&gt; Click Here! &lt;/href&gt;

Tags

•    Start with the most general which is the platform the article is for \(GCcollab, GCconnex, etc.\)

•    Work from general to specific.

•    Make sure you have equivalent tags in French as well.

•    Tags are used not only to search for articles, but also to populate the Related Articles sidebar. Keep this in mind while tagging articles; consider which articles are useful to show together.

Style for Terms and Grammar

These terms are written as such:

•    Dropdown

•    Eg.

•    Email

•    Cog icon \(not settings icon\)

•    Keywords

•    Members \(not users\)

•    On the page \(not in\)

•    Profile \(not profile page\)

•    Profile card

•    Avatar \(not profile icon\)

•    Trashcan

•    URL

•    Username

Stylistic grammar rules:

•    Commas: Use sparingly and only when necessary to improve comprehension. No Oxford comma.

•    Hyphens/Semi-colons: Use sparingly, usually a period will suffice.

•    Periods/Punctuation: End every sentence with some form of punctuation.

•    Describing User Interactions

•    User interactions should use precise and consistent terminology.
