# Tags, Chips and Pills

## Tags

Tags represent a set of user-generated keywords that help label, organize, and categorize content. They are useful for providing metadata that makes content searchable. Tags can be added or removed from content by the author.

Tags are usually displayed near the title of the content, in close proximity to other information such as the date posted, number of likes, and author.

Tags are rectangular with a border radius of 4px. The left side of the tag is stylized using a_** triangle and white circle**_.\_**\(revisit this\) **\_Tags use the secondary colours in the chosen palette, and the text colour will be either black or white depending on the tag colour. Refer to the colour section for more information on which text colours to use.

Tags may also include a right-aligned remove button beside the text. This button is represented as a black/white circle with a transparent x.

Tags are sized to match the length of the keywords. With padding of 7px on the top, right and bottom, and 10px on the left

## Chips

Chips represent contact information, typically including a user's avatar and name, with a link to their profile.

Chips are rectangular with a border radius of 4px. An avatar image is displayed on the left side of the chip. Chips are sized to match the length of the user's profile name. Chips have padding of 7px on all sides.

Chips have 3 different variations and are displayed as follows:

**Normal: **CECECE. Black text. Small avatar \(26 x 26px\) aligned to the left.
