# Data Visualizations

Data visualizations come in many forms, and are a visual means to represent a data set. The type of data visualization chosen should always be appropriate for the type of data used.

Data visualizations should aim to represent and answer one question. The goal is to provide a brief overview of the data, and tell a visual story that makes sense to the user. Graphs should be used to visually represent datasets in ways that tables cannot. If the data is easy to understand without a visualization, usually the simplest option \(a table\) is best.

## Simplicity

A general rule for data visualizations is to keeps the visual elements as simple as possible. Only necessary information such as labels, values, and bars or lines should be present. A key or legend should be provided for more complex data that may have multiple colours or types of information. Colours and other visual elements should always be kept to a minimum when possible.

Visuals should only enhance the data, and should never distract. Best practices include eliminating backgrounds, lightening grids, and reducing the number of colours used in a graph.

If one graph is too complex to represent a certain dataset, the data should be represented in multiple, simple graphs.

\(Include do and don't image\)

## Labels

### Graph Titles

Graph and table titles in this design system use the typography style for [heading 2. ](/typography.md)Titles should be as short as possible, and accurately reflect the question the dataset is trying to represent. Titles always use title-case capitalization.

### Axis Labelling

Both the x and y axes should always be labelled. Labels should be placed outside of the data area. Labels should use simple and clear language, and accurately represent the data being show. Axis labels use the typographic style for[ heading 4](/typography.md).

For quantitative labels, the unit of measurement should be included in the label.

### Data Increments

Qualitative data values should be labelled in a logical way, such as consecutive months. For quantitative values, they should be labelled using round numbers or decimals that fit the data range. Always include an additional increment greater than the datset. For quantitative values,  axes should always start at 0.When using decimals, always round to a maximum of two decimal points.

In some visualizations with many axis points, skipping labels is an effective way to reduce visual clutter. Skipping labels can vary depending on the data, but the intervals between labels should always be consistent. \(i.e. skip every second label\)

On the x-axis, value labels should be centered to their corresponding tick mark. For y-axis labels, they should be left-aligned and kept above the y-axis lines.

### Data Formats and Abbreviations

When possible, labels and values should avoid abbreviations unless it is a conventional data format.  If spacing is a concern, it is recommended to skip labels in a way that makes sense for the data. Value labels should never be slanted to save space.

Some data formats should always use abbreviations:

| Days of the week | Mon, Tues, Wed, Thurs, Fri, Sat, Sun |
| :--- | :--- |
| Months | Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec |
| 12-hour time | 1am, 2pm, 12pm etc. |
| Standard money abbreviations | $1.2k, $3.4m, $6.2b, etc. |

## Use of Colour

Graphs and visualizations should always aim to use as little colour as possible. If multiple colours are required, they should be a complimentary palette that are both distinguishable when placed in close proximity. Colour choice should avoid bias \(i.e. red or green\) unless specifically related to the data \(i.e. a decrease or increase\). Any colour is acceptable for a visualization so long as it meets contrast requirements. For more information about colour choice, visit the [colour section](/colour.md).

See specific types of visualizations for use of colour. In general, each variable should ave one designated colour, and only graphs showing multiple variables should have multiple colours.
